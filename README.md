## Background

I loved doing this project! I was learning Swift trough tutorials and wanted a practical project to try my learnings. 
At that time i was studying in Barcelona for a year and mostly sitting in cafes, learning Swift. And I like working in different places, 
so I always looked for chill cafes with wifi and plugins. So after I while, I thought it would be cool to have an App for that :D 

So I learned Swift in Cafes in Barcelona, while writing this App for people like me who wanna do that.

This project was in the App Store, but was later replaced by the next Version of the App

with the Github Repo:
